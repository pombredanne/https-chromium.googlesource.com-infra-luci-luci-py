      "message": "1) It makes sense to remove these subtractions as the field name `bot_overhead` makes people assume that it includes all overheads.\nWe can change the logic in TaskResult.to_proto() to subtract overheads to calculate `other_overhead`. \n\n2) If you revert this change, we still need to fix the \u0027Total overhead\u0027 to `Other overheads` in the UI.\n\nI\u0027m fine with either.\nWhich do you think is better?",

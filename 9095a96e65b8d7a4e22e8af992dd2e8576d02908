The errors come from jobs/requested, jobs/completed and jobs/running also expecting the device_type field. I am not sure if it\u0027s less destructive to add \u0027device_type\u0027 to all of them, or just make the \u0027device_type\u0027 a special case for the jobs/max_pending_duration?\n(example: WrongFieldsError: Metric \"jobs/running\" is defined with [\u0027pool\u0027, \u0027project_id\u0027, \u0027spec_name\u0027, \u0027subproject_id\u0027] fields but was given [\u0027device_type\u0027, \u0027project_id\u0027, \u0027spec_name\u0027, \u0027pool\u0027, \u0027subproject_id\u0027])\nThanks so much for your help!",

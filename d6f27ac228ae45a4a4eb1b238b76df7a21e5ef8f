      "message": "This will return a token that can expire as soon as 1m from now (see `-lifetime` in `luci-auth token -help`). IIUC findLiveDemoTokens() is called only once. One option would be to set `-lifetime 20m` or something, but the token will still eventually expire.\n\nAnother option is to use `luci-auth token -json-output -` and use `expiry` field from the output to know when this token expires, and ask a new one when it does. It means /auth/openid/state bypass will have to call some function every time.\n\nI guess /auth/openid/state bypass can also just always call the current implementation of findLiveDemoTokens(), and it will be mostly OK, except `luci-auth info` actually makes a backend call to resolve the token and thus it is relatively slow. We can precache email, but keep always calling `luci-auth token` (it should be super fast if the token is up-to-date).",

      "message": "Nit: Should this also be called `ClaimError` since there is also a `ClaimError` on the server side? \n\nI think a few subtle errors that could cause: \n1. Autoimporting the incorrect `ClaimError` without noticing it. \n2. They have subtly different meanings. This `ClaimError` is an unexpected failure vs the \"server\" `ClaimError` being expected. Maybe that would be confusing to someone who is reading the code for the first time. \n\nThe unfortunate part is that if we changed `ClaimError` to `UnexpectedClaimError` or `BotClaimError` or `ClaimRpcError` it would be inconsistent with the other error names.\n\nI\u0027m not 100% sure if either of those listed things are a real issue so it\u0027s probably fine to not action? Also I am unsure whether there should actually a precedent of everything in the swarming code base having a globally (across all modules) unique name is a sensible thing to have.",

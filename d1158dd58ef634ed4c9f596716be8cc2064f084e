      "message": "Imagine the server is broken and returns HTTP 500 on all responses. Then \"swarming collect -timeout -1\" will hang forever. I think this is not expected behavior. It should given up trying after few attempts. Consider doing something like:\n\ndeadline \u003d started\nif timeout \u003e 0:\n  deadline +\u003d timeout\nelif timeout \u003d\u003d 0:\n  deadline \u003d None  # try forever\nelse:\n  deadline +\u003d 300  # give up on HTTPs 500 after 5 min\n\nOr alternatively pass retry_50x\u003dTrue on line 536 if timeout is -1, and exit on error (instead of \u0027continue\u0027 on line 538). This may be even better, since url_read_json does real exponential backoff IIRC, not linear line 523-528.",

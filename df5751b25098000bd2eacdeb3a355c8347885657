I did minor changes for logging, but it looks working.\n\nNote that _cleanup_purgeable_space() may take longer than 10 minutes, which mark the bot as dead because no requests are sent to the server during `dd`ing.\n\nI think this CL is ready for submit.\nbut, there are no quarantined bots on prod at this moment.\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/7BNgLHe4LrsGqvQ\nSo let me submit/deploy this CL when we find those bots next time.",

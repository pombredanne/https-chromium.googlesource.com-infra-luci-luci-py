      "message": "Hi Yiwei, I started to add a main.star to generate just tricium-prod.cfg, but found that just the `luci.cq_tryjob_verifier` depended on defining cq_group, bucket, etc... so I tried just dumping in most of everything from the infra repo config; although I feel this is a little silly, and probably not the right way to do things.\n\nAny thoughts?",

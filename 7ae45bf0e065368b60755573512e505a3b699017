They will use pools that don\u0027t have `default_task_realm`. I expect all LUCI stuff to be in this category.\n2. Clients that don\u0027t care about realms at all. They will rely exclusively on `default_task_realm`. I expect cast-swarming and omnibot stuff to be in this category (at least initially).\n\nI want to warn only when client from category (1) \"forget\" to set `realm` in TaskRequest. I don\u0027t want to warn on calls from (2) at all. (To be honest I\u0027m currently mostly ðŸ™ˆ on cast-swarming and omnibot and will deal with them after migrating LUCI stuff).",

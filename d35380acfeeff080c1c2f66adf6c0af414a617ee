      "message": "Adding a default value here because:\n1. not having one breaks tests\n2. I am following advice in python docs:\n```\nrequired option\nan option that must be supplied on the command-line; note that the phrase “required option” is self-contradictory in English. optparse doesn’t prevent you from implementing required options, but doesn’t give you much help at it either.\n```\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html\n\nThis case would never actually happen in production since `--cipd-cache` argument is always provided to `run_isolate.py` by `task_runner.py` so this option mostly applies to tests which is why I think this value is fine.",

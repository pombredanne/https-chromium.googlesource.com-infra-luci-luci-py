If the VM\u0027s been leased then we must know how long it\u0027s been leased for, either indefinitely, or until lease_expiration_ts.\n\nCreated https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/infra/luci/luci-py/+/1175239 to address race condition putting MachineLeases in this weird state. After that we\u0027ll need to revert, because the behavior needs to match the assertion.",

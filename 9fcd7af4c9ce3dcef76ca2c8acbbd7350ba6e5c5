      "message": "`try_number\u003d0` -\u003e deduped which means no performance stats. However after doing a bit more testing I discovered that there are other non-deduped tasks which could actually return performance stats even if the task did not run since `protorpc` seems to just create `non-falsy` performance stats objects.\n\nIt seems like the `performance_stats` object has a `is_valid` method which should be used for this test instead.",

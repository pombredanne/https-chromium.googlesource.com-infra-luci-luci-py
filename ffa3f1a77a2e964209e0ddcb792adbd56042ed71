      "message": "This script has at least two issues:\n1. It copies Swarming own protos back into luci-py, resulting in duplicated protos which is very confusing:\n * Original: https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-py/+/refs/heads/main/appengine/swarming/proto/api/swarming.proto\n * Copy of a copy: https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-py/+/refs/heads/main/appengine/swarming/bb_backend_proto/go.chromium.org/luci/swarming/proto/api/swarming.proto\n\n2. At least this stuff is copied uselessly https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/common/proto/googleapis/. It needs to passed to protoc via separate `--proto_path` to take any effect (e.g. like cproto does https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/main/common/proto/protoc/inputs.go#164). update_taskbackend_protos.py doesn\u0027t do this, yet everything works, thus I think all copied proto/googleapis/ is useless junk.\n\nI think the script should copy ONLY files that are necessary in luci-py, especially considering its copying them under \"appengine/swarming\" directory. It should be only files necessary by Swarming, not all random junk in luci-go repo. And it definitely should not copy Swarming protos back into Swarming under a different name.\n\nIf you prefer, I can make these changes. Let me know.",

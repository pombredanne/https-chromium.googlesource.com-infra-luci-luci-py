It was my understanding that we would import the full nsjail proto into swarming, but that the task properties message in swarming_rpcs.py would include only a subset of those properties.

In this case, I\u0027m not sure it makes sense to create a custom proto message that is a subset of the nsjail configuration; any time we wanted to use a new feature, we would need to roll the RPC definition, which doesn\u0027t seem like a good way to do things.\n\nFrom that comment thread, it seems that the main reason to have a subset is to do the strictness comparison between task properties and pool defaults. Is that correct? If so, I think we\u0027re willing to avoid the comparison for now.",

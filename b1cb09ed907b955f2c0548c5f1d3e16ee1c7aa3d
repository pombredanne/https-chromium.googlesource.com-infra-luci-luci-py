      "message": "The more I think about bot health state, the more I think it needs a bigger refactoring.\n\nIn practice, I\u0027m thinking of a follow up that makes these strings, which would enable putting the rationale there. But that\u0027s out of scope for this CL.\n\nThat said, we could put maintenance_msg here right away, so basically:\n- Add indexed\u003dFalse to quarantined at line 101. Since composite is now the reference, indexing on quarantined is not needed anymore and will be a small performance boost. Add a comment above, just after line 100 with just: https://crbug.com/839415\n- Use maintenance_msg here, so that it stores a string. This is to help with https://crbug.com/839415 down the road. Make it indexed\u003dFalse too.\n\nThis means you need to update call sites too.",

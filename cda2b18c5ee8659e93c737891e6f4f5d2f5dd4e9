      "message": "Can you link an example where we do this? I see DEPS.py in the client directory, but it appears to just be a dictionary of revisions. It doesn\u0027t actually seem to be used to fetch CIPD packages at test time.\n\nAdditionally, I\u0027m not sure I see a lot of value to running the real nsjail. The purpose of this test is to verify that subprocess42.Popen rewrites the command correctly to invoke nsjail - not to verify that nsjail itself runs correctly (that should be tested in the nsjail tests).",

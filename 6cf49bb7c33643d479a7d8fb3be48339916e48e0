      "message": "More context: a 429 means that the server did handle the request properly. A 500 just means \"I broke\" where a 429 means an orderly failure. It\u0027s subtle but important distinction from a monitoring point of view; we may tolerate a fairly large rate of 429, but in the end we should almost never get 500 under normal circumstances. Monitoring should be adapted accordingly. I historically didn\u0027t do a good job at fixing this.",

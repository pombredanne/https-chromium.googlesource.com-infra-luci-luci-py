There\u0027ll be a race condition between the RPC handler and the transaction. If the handler is fast enough, it will see pre-committed state.\n3. A transaction can get retried, resulting in multiple RPCs.\n\nThis RPC need to happen from a transactionally enqueued task (submitted by _maybe_taskupdate_notify_via_tq in this case). That way the RPC will happen if and only if the transaction lands (but RPC or the TQ handler still needs to be idempotent, since a TQ task may be delivered more than once due to transient errors and retries).",

      "message": "\u003e Calling RPCs in transactions is not safe\n\nI understand this\n\n\u003e This RPC need to happen from a transactionally enqueued task\n\nI don\u0027t think TQ is the right choice here. \n\n`StartBuildTask` needs to return before `bot/poll` or `bot/claim` returns. This is because the `secret_bytes` that get updated with `StartBuildTaskResponse.Secrets` are used to construct the `BuildbucketAgentContext` file. `secret_bytes` is returned by `task_scheduler.bot_claim_slice` (or `task_scheduler.bot_reap_task`).\nand in both of those functions they use `_reap_task`, which is why I\u0027m editing it. \n\nI think that the `StartBuildTask` RPC call can be pulled out of the transaction, but it should happen right after the transaction (right after this call https://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/main:luci/appengine/swarming/server/task_scheduler.py;l\u003d371-372)\n\nWDYT?",

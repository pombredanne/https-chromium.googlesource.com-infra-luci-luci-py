This is a full replacement for `certifi` PyPI package imported by several of our
third-party dependencies. They all import `where()` function and nothing more.

The original `certifi` code (starting from some revision) no longer works
correctly when this package is embedded into a python zip module at a
non-default path. This happens in swarming_bot.zip.

We also do not really want to depend on `cacert.pem` from the certifi package at
all. Instead we trust Google root certificates:

```
curl -sL URL: "https://pki.google.com/roots.pem" > cacert.pem
```

      "message": "- Does this mean that this is called when a bot makes a request to the swarming server indicating that it has changed state somehow?\n- I was just trying to think of whether this would be better if this function took a dict instead of a list of arguments, but I don\u0027t think that would necessarily improve it.\n- Most function names start with a verb, would it make sense to call it register_bot_event or add_bot_event or such? Keeping it as bot_event is also alright since that\u0027s shorter.",

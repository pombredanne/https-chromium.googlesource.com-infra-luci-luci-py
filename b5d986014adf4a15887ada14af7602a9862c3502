      "message": "this looks bad to me because it couples implementation of FetchQueue to the expectations that callers will never add new items to \u0027digests\u0027, i.e. this is now becomes wrong:\n\nq.wait({1 ,2})\nq.wait({1, 2, 3, 4}) # oops, 3 and 4 will never be processed\n\n(I also suspect we do this exact thing when fetching included *.isolated files).\n\nIf you still want to keep _fetched_digests (and I\u0027m not convinced it is useful), then \u0027wait\u0027 API should change to be just wait(), e.g. something like:\n\nq.add_to_wait_set({1, 2})\nq.wait()\nq.add_to_wait_set({3, 4})\nq.wait()\n...\n\nSo misuse is less probable.",

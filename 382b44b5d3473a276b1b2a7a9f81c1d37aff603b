      "message": "This is a trick to get data from `swarming-dev` and use it locally for testing with the UI. What happens is that requests which are sent to `/auth` (so initial /auth/oid/state` request) gets proxied and sent with a `lucisid` cookie injected. That request will then be returned with the credentials needed to access swarming-dev in the `live_demo` mode. \n\nThis does not effect the actual UI since it is part of `webpack-dev-server` as a proxy.",

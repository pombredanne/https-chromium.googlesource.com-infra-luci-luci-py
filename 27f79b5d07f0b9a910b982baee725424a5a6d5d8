      "message": "I have a general questions about this CL:\n\nThere are timeouts with `ndb.transactions`. The transactions also retry if they conflict with other transactions[1]. Is there a greater risk for the entities collected in the one big transaction to either:\n1. never be applied since there are conflicts in a small number of the entities which are being updated\n2. timeout since there could be numerous entities which are stale and the transaction takes longer than 1 minute\n\nMy other question is where one can find good metrics about contention in the database. I have discovered http://screen/BTWBxtkoqTVEZ4Y which I don\u0027t understand yet. Are there some other places I should look? \n\n- [1] https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/legacy/standard/python/ndb/transactions",

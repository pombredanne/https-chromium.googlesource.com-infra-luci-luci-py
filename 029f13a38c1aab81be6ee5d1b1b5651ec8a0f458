      "message": "I think I want to push the cancellations to the cancel-tasks task queue (since I already see a handler there that knows how to cancel by id, and this will allow for some parallelism).\n\nHowever, 2 questions:\n 1) I don\u0027t actually see any code within swarming that seems to reference cancel-tasks or that pushes anything on to it. Is there, that I can adapt from?\n 2) I\u0027d want to add \"cancel only if on this bot\" semantics, or \"cancel only this try #\" semantics. Opinion?",

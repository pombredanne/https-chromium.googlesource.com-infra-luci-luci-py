Something like:\n\n  // Maximum delay between bot pings before the bot is considered dead\n  // while running a task.\n  //\n  // When a task is running, the bot sends update to the server every\n  // few seconds. In some cases, like when the system is overloaded,\n  // the bot may be preempted and delayed in sending its updates.\n  // After the delay specified here, the server will claim the bot to\n  // be dead and will forcibly abort the task as BOT_DIED. This is to\n  // catch system wide issues like a BSOD.",

      "message": "I have only very vague idea what is actually going on inside. The actual code flow in this code is super complicated. I suspect this `run1` actually advances all various ndb tasklets inside. I also don\u0027t really understand when it unblock. Documentation says:\n\n```\nRun one item (a callback or an RPC wait_any) or sleep.\n\nReturns\nTrue if something happened; False if all queues are empty.\n```\n\nwhich is super vague\n\nI assume it may take arbitrary small amount of time if there are many tasklets running (and it is very possible there are, since caller of _yield_potential_tasks launches a tasklet per yielded item). So I opted to making this loop as fast to spin as possible (in particular replacing O(N) `any(futures)` with O(1) `queries`, where N is up to 30).",

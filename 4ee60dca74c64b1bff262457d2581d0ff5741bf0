      "message": "The current values are all over the top in swarming_rpcs.py. The expectation was that some states would eventually become a bit mask but this never concretized. So any other value is fine. We could use the current 0xN0 values but it\u0027s not a requirement; albeit it will make porting a bit harder for clients.",

      "message": "Optional nit: While it may not look like, I tried to keep as little logic in this file and push the logic into the files in server/*.py as much as possible. That\u0027s adding a fair amount of logic.\n\nThat said, I\u0027m fine with committing this here for now and eventually look at refactoring later. It\u0027s not a big deal and getting this in ASAP is more important.",

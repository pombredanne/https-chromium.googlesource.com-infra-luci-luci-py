Someone may rely on this. \n\ni\u0027ve added a test in \nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/infra/luci/luci-py/+/1093374/1..2/appengine/components/components/endpoints_webapp2/adapter_test.py\nand it fails in L115\n\nThis whole thing is tricky. It is not obvious what\u0027s the correct behavior just by looking at paths (is order important?...), so i guess we have to replicate exactly what endpoints do. What do they do in this case?",

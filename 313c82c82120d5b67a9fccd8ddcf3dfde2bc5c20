      "message": "The module `six` is provided to the runtime by the copy in `third_party/six`. Having this import at the top of the file prevents users without a system copy of `six` from ever getting anything working, since getting the `third_party` folder mapped in itself requires `six`, since without `six`, python will attempt to load this file, hit the import, and fail out. By scoping the import inside a function, it is not resolved until that function is actually called; at this point, the location where `utils/tools.py` is imported will already have called the function to map in the `third_party` folder to the module search path.",

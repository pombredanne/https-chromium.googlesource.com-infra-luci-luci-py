      "message": "Oh, what do you think about:\n- Keep them in swarming_rpcs.py, actually move all messages here back to this file.\n- Rename them so the fooRequest and result has similar name, right now it\u0027s quite inconsistent.\n\nI\u0027m actually a bit ambivalent about this, the other option is to move all messages in here. Either way I\u0027d prefer inputs and outputs messages to be listed at the same place so either all here or all in swarming_rpcs.\n\nI think it\u0027s now become large enough that it could warrant one source file per API surface but that\u0027s out of scope of for this CL.",

      "message": "One place makes sense to me. I\u0027m also not sure whether they should all be here or all be in swarming_rpcs.py. They seem to go with the stuff that\u0027s here, having to reference two files just to see what the endpoints methods are seems cumbersome, but on the other hand it would increase this file size by 50% or more, which might make it hard to read. Maybe handlers_endpoints.py could be split into separate files for each endpoint, then each remote.Service class and its relevant message.Message classes could be together in one file.\n\nAgreed it\u0027s out of scope though, currently this CL is consistent since other resource containers are already declared here.",

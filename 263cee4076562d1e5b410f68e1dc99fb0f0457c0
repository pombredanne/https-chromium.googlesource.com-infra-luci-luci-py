      "message": "[1] talks through a case where v8 project configures a chromium tryjob to run. LUCIProject() returns \"v8\" in this case.\n\nHowever, the chromium tryjob will be uploading test results to a realm in chromium (e.g. chromium:try), and this is the project that LUCI CV will need to access ResultDB with, not \"v8\".\n\nThat said, maybe you can still get at the builder project somehow? The description references a config \"chromium/try/linux_rel\", so somewhere in CV there might be the actual project for the tryjob?",

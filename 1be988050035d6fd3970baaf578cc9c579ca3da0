I\u0027ll simplify this to track only actual scheduling latency (i.e. keep only `outcome \u003d\u003d claimed`) and remove slice index (to reduce storage space requirements, we don\u0027t really care about the index).\n\nThis will make this metric similar to state_change_scheduling_latencies, except it will not be weird for multi-slice tasks or cancelled tasks or expired tasks. It will just track the scheduler end-to-end performance (including queuing delay).",

      "message": "I did attempt to use interceptors but decided on this approach bc:\n1. Interceptors run after the request has been parsed and associated with a specific prpc method. That means sending metrics in such an interceptor would result in those cases being missed. \n2. The status code of the `prpc` handler can also change when running other interceptors. So rather have something which runs on the outside and catches all cases.",

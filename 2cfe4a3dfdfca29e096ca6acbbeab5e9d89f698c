      "message": "When Endpoints v1 is disabled, the Endpoints v1 proxy just lets requests pass through. So this should work, but with a little extra latency compared to /api (but not more than Endpoints v1 services have at /_ah/api). After August 2nd they\u0027re presumably going to remove the proxy altogether.\n\nMachine Provider is working this way, we\u0027re serving using the adapter at /_ah/api. I think that the /_ah/spi path magically enables the Endpoints v1 proxy, and removing it here means the proxy operates in pass through mode.",

      "message": "Changes to actual code are quite small in this CL. Lots of unit tests needed to be refactored since they depended on the BotEvent.Key being ordered in a monotonically increasing sequence. So it was possible to mock BotEvent.ts as a constant and not effect the test outcome. But now we depend on BotEvent.ts for ordering so all those tests had to be modified to account for this.  ",

We could do more work on this like figure out the \"default\" realm or show users a list of realms they have access too but I don\u0027t think doing that really adds much value on top of just doing this frontend change. I intend this as a \"power user\" feature and most people probably not change the realm. \n\nScreenshot: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/BTyEekfEARjTnFQ",

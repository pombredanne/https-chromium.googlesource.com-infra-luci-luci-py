      "message": "It\u0027s True by default (see the definition of MachineType), so a comment feels redundant to me. I think the removal of line 383 is only confusing because it was there before. If you\u0027re reading the code for the first time (and not a diff) and you don\u0027t know that line ever existed then I think it makes sense the way it is.\n\nReading from the start of this loop body everything is commented:\n1. If there is no config, disable the MachineType.\n2. Re-enable disabled MachineTypes.\n3. Handle scheduled config changes.\n4. If the MachineType does not match the config, update it.\n\nWhat do you think?",

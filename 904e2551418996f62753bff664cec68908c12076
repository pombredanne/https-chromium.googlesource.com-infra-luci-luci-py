      "message": "endpoints.api_server knows how to figure out what classes are associated with handlers_endpoints.swarming_api, but endpoints_webapp2.api_server does not. I could add this feature, it\u0027s quite straightforward, but Swarming is the only app which needs it and it\u0027s strictly for convenience so I\u0027m just explicitly listing all the classes here instead. This is what Swarming\u0027s doing for the /api routes anyways.\n\nSpeaking of which, this doesn\u0027t affect /api routes. I need to update clients to point back at /_ah/api, then remove /api routes later on.",

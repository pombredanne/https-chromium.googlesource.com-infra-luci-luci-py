I don\u0027t know if it would break users.\n\nOther option is to use a relative path inside the mapped tree, that\u0027s now supported too.\n\nAnother option is to base64 the json data passed passed at the command line. Or pass it through a file. I assume this doens\u0027t work because of this passed through kitchen?",

Here\u0027s an example task for reference: https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/task?id\u003d3ad4d66af3014810\u0026refresh\u003d10\u0026request_detail\u003dtrue  If there\u0027s a smarter way to pass in the properties dict, that should work, although we do need to know the ISOLATED_OUTDIR inside the recipe.  So base64 or a file would only work if we could obtain ISOLATED_OUTDIR some other way.",

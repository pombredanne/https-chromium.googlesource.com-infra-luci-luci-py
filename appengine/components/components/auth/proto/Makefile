compile:
	# If we simply compile *.proto files relative to this dir, the recorded file
	# names in the generated _pb2.py are relative to this dir too which may
	# introduce naming collisions in the protobuf registry.
	#
	# Move the proto path to //appengine/components to "namespace" proto files.
	# This is consistent with other components assuming that "components" is in
	# the import path.

  """A task dimensions hash and a list of dimension sets that match it.

  Root entity. Key ID is
    * `bot:<url-encoded-id>:<dimensions_hash>` - for tasks targeting a bot.
    * `pool:<url-encoded-id>:<dimensions_hash>` - for tasks targeting a pool.

  Where `<url-encoded-id>` is an URL encoding of bot or pool ID (primarily to
  quote `:`, since it is allowed in pool IDs) and `<dimensions_hash>` is a
  32 bit integer with the task dimensions hash as generated by
  hash_dimensions(...).

  Presence of this entity indicates that there's potentially a pending task
  that matches `<dimensions_hash>` and matching bots should be polling the
  corresponding TaskToRun queue.

  For tasks that use OR-ed dimensions (`{"k": "a|b"}`), the `<dimensions_hash>`
  is taken over the original dimensions (with "|" still inside), but the stored
  dimensions set are flat i.e. `sets` logically stores two separate dimension
  sets: `{"k": "a"}` and `{"k": "b"}`.

  If there's a collision on `<dimensions_hash>` (i.e. two different dimensions
  sets hash to the same value), `sets` stores dimensions sets from all colliding
  entries. Collisions are eventually resolved when bots poll for tasks: they
  get all tasks that match `<dimensions_hash>`, and then filter out ones that
  don't actually match bot's dimensions.

  A TaskDimensionsSets entity is always accompanied by TaskDimensionsInfo
  entity. TaskDimensionsSets entity stores infrequently changing (but frequently
  scanned) data, while TaskDimensionsInfo contains all data (including
  frequently changing data, like expiration timestamps). This separation reduces
  churn in TaskDimensionsSets datastore indexes (improving performance of full
  rescans that happen in _tq_rescan_matching_task_sets_async), as well as
  improves caching efficiency of direct ndb.get_multi fetches of
  TaskDimensionsSets in assert_bot(...).

  """Expands |dimensions| to a series of dimensions_flat.

  If OR is not used, the result contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it
  expands the OR dimension into a series of basic dimensions, then flattens each
  one of them.

  Returns: a list of dimensions_flat expanded from |dimensions|. A
  dimensions_flat is a sorted list of '<key>:<value>' of the basic dimensions.

  This function can be called with invalid dimensions that are reported by the
  bot. Tolerate them, but trim dimensions longer than 321 characters (the limit
  is 64+256+1=321). This is important, otherwise handling the returned values
  that are too long can throw while trying to store this in the datastore.

  The challenge here is that we're handling unicode strings, but we need to
  count in term of utf-8 bytes while being efficient.

  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8, the longest UTF-8 encoded
  character is 4 bytes.

  Keys are strictly a subset of ASCII, thus valid keys are at most 64 bytes.

  Values can be any unicode string limited to 256 characters. So the worst
  case is 1024 bytes for a valid value.

  This means that the maximum valid string is 64+1+1024 = 1089 bytes, where 1 is
  the ':' character which is one byte.

  One problem is that because surrogate code points are used to encode
  characters outside the base plane in UTF-16, a UCS2 build of Python may use
  two Unicode code points for one characters, so len('😬') returns 2, even
  though it returns 1 on a UCS4 build.

  So it means that the limit is effectively halved for non-BMP characters,
  depending on the python build used.

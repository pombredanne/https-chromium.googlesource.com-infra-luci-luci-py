- BotEvent is a monotonically inserted entity that is added for each event
  happening for the bot.
- BotInfo is a 'dump-only' entity used for UI, it permits quickly show the
  state of every bots in an single query. It is basically a cache of the last
  BotEvent and additionally updated on poll. It doesn't need to be updated in a
  transaction.
- BotSettings contains bot-specific settings. It must be updated in a
  transaction and contains admin-provided settings, contrary to the other
  entities which are generated from data provided by the bot itself.

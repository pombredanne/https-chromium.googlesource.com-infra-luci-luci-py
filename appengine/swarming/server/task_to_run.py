class _TaskToRunBase(ndb.Model):
  """Defines a TaskRequest slice ready to be scheduled on a bot.

  Each TaskRequest results in one or more TaskToRunShard entities (one per
  slice). They are created sequentially, one by one, as the task progresses
  through its slices. Each TaskToRunShard is eventually either picked up by
  a bot for execution or expires. Each TaskToRunShard picked up for execution
  has an associated task_result.TaskResult entity (expired ones don't).

  A TaskToRunShard can be in two states:
  - reapable: queue_number and expiration_ts are both not None.
  - consumed: queue_number and expiration_ts are both None.

  The entity starts its life in reapable state and then transitions to consumed
  state either by being picked up by a bot for execution or when it expires.
  Consumed state is final.

  This entity must be kept small and contain the minimum amount of data (in
  particular indexes) for two reasons:
  - It is created and transactionally mutated at high QPS.
  - Each bot_reap_task(...) runs a datastore scan for available TaskToRunShard.

  The key id is:
  - lower 4 bits is the try number. The only supported values are 1.
  - next 5 bits are TaskResultSummary.current_task_slice (shifted by 4 bits).
  - rest is 0.

  TODO(crbug.com/1065101): Try number is always 1 now. Swarming-level retries
  have been removed. Anything related to try numbers is dead code that needs to
  be cleaned up.

  This is a base class of TaskToRunShard, and get_shard_kind() should be used
  to get a TaskToRunShard kind. The shard number is derived deterministically by
  calculating dimensions hash % N_SHARDS.

      "message": "I think you actually just want to omit these pubsub fields; These were only needed to signal buildbucket when the task changed state, but now this should be done via the TaskBackend API (i.e. some mechanism internal to swarming)\n\nIf it were me, I would store some metadata (maybe as a swarming tag?) which, when the task changes state, can translate into a TaskBackend call (via task-queue, similar to how pubsub notifications work, IIUC. Could even be the existing pubsub notifier handlers, maybe?)",

Any task can read any other task\u0027s command line within the same pool. The \u0027pass via CLI\u0027 option is only for backends which prevent tasks from reading each-others stuff by default (e.g. RBE... I think. Otherwise we\u0027ll have to ask for a SecretBytes impl there as well).",

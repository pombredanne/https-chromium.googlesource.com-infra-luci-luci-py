      "message": "Another change to better support aix on luci.\n\nNote, the current AIX builder is actually a POWER9, but has been compiling for POWER8. There were issues switching to GOPPC64\u003dpower9 on the AIX CI previously, it is unlikely those were fixed.",

      "message": "Thanks. This change looks good to me, but I defer to a swarming owner for the remaining review.\n\nIf I understanding correctly, this improves the CPU detection to report the GOPPC64 support (power8/9/10) which is useful for informative purposes when looking at the builder information, and in the future to be able to distinguish between aix-ppc64 machines of different capabilities, but it\u0027s not strictly needed now for go.dev/issue/67299, right? Just confirming.",

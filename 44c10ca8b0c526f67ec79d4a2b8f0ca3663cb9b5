      "message": "My mistake in previous CL was that I did not realize that pRPC converts `snake_case` protobuf fields to `camelCase` - https://crsrc.org/i/luci/appengine/swarming/proto/api_v2/swarming.proto;l\u003d945?q\u003dfilepath:swarming.proto and then didn\u0027t notice this in testing. \n\nThere are two approaches for doing the migration. \n\n1. we could have written code to convert between `snake_case` and `camelCase` at this level and not change anything in the UI. This might have been easier but it\u0027s also hacky and adds complexity since we have an extra step before data reaches the UI. \n2. Don\u0027t do anything, just leave response as `camelCase` and change the actual UI.\n\nEnded up going with (2).",

A swarming bot can run from other directories. \n\nHow about getting the current working directory (e.g. `C:\\b\\w\\blah`) and converting it into a list of paths like `[\u0027C:\\\u0027, \u0027C:\\b\\\u0027, \u0027C:\\b\\w\\\u0027, \u0027C:\\b\\w\\blah\u0027]` and checking all of them? (in addition to all of letters of the alphabet).",

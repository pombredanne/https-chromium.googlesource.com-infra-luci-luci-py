      "message": "Here, task 1 and task 2 both are filtered by task_result.yield_run_result_keys_with_dead_bot() and processed inspite of having .dead_after_ts \u003d None for task 1. So, ideally task 1 should have been filtered out and only task 2 should be in the output list of the query. \nIf I put filter on state \u003d\u003d RUNNING (as before), it only outputs task 2.\n\nSame observation applied to the assert statement in the next line.\n\nIs the value for .dead_after_ts \u003d None not being written in DB immediately after it is set in task_scheduler._handle_dead_bot() or the query doesn\u0027t put any filter on fields with null values?",

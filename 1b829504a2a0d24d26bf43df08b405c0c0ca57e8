The rationale is that when comments are updated at one of the files, the other will likely not be updated (empirical observation is a probability \u003e50%).",

      "message": "Usually agreed, but in this case copying the comments adds value. The comments end up in the generated go code, which end up in the godocs for the generated code, which is easily available to users of the generated code without having to cross reference back to the python code.\n\nIf anything, that would argue that this proto is the source of truth on the comments and not the python code, but I didn\u0027t want to delete all those python comments because that seems to reduce value for those working in the python codebase.",

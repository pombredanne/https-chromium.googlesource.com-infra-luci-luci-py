How do you feel about something like:\nu\u0027%s.%s-%d\u0027 % (version_number, build_number, sys.getwindowsversion().product_type)\n\nI\u0027m not sure whether/how build_number corresponds to platform.win32_ver()[2].\n\nObviously this new value would be in addition to the existing values, although I would propose that we not add \"2016Server\".",

If new methods are written just for the backend api handlers they should also raise these exceptions and the handler itself won\u0027t worry about try-excepting.\nIf a handler has to call common methods that already raise other exceptions that can\u0027t easily be changed, they will be try-excepted at the backend handler level.\n\nShould not be difficult to change if we find a better strategy later.\nhappy for feedback.",

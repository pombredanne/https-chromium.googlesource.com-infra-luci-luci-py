      "message": "The previous implementation also did it (and it broke my brain a little bit trying to understand how). See _EXTEND_VALIDITY usage in this file. What broke my brain is how it is interrelated with _KEEP_DEAD and \"jitter\" in _assert_task_props_old_async and various expiry checks (that sometimes account for _KEEP_DEAD and sometimes not).\n\nMy implementation essentially repeats what _EXTEND_VALIDITY and \"jitter\" did, except tries to comment it better (dunno, maybe the previous implementation was also clear and I\u0027m just dumb). They are important for reasons I tried to explain in comments.\n\nI decided to reduce _EXTEND_VALIDITY from 4h to 2h and completely remove _KEEP_DEAD (since I have a feeling it was added as a workaround to avoid exploding transactions when frequently updating TaskDimensions). As a result in the new implementation we\u0027ll store task dimension sets at most 2h 35min past their real expiration. In the old implementation that number was around 28h (_KEEP_DEAD + _EXTEND_VALIDITY) which looks too much to me (i.e. if we run a task even once, we keep storing and **scanning** its TaskDimensions for more than a day). I suspect it\u0027s one of the reasons chromeos-swarming sometimes has 50K \"active\" TaskDimensions (some portion of them are dead junk from the day before).",

      "message": "Actually I\u0027ll make it 5h instead of 2h for now, to smooth the transition. The next CL will add a cron that backfills TaskDimensionsSets based on existing TaskDimensions from the old implementation. It will be better if TaskDimensionsSets stored via _assert_task_dimensions_async have larger expiration than TaskDimensions stored by the old implementation, to avoid adding extra ongoing work to the backfill cron. Once we switch to the new implementation, I\u0027ll reduce it back to 2h or maybe even less.",
